This is a mini app used to record your jogging or cycling activities.

## 2. How to use ?

It is easy to use this app, you just simply click a random place where you want to record your activity on the map then an input form will be displayed,
you fill it with some necessary informations and done. The app should now record this activity with your filled-in information, this record and any other records
will be kept even if you reload the page.

There may be some other features in the future like: tracking the path from place to place where you jogged or cycled, display traffic density on the map,...
